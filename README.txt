Yilin Liu&Jie Zheng- Final Project
TinNews

Description:

Our final project is called TinNews. It provides latest news for users in order to let them know everything and collect the news they like.

Once users open our app, the main page shows the card view news. There are also three tool bars on the bottom shows different functions of our app. Tin shows the card View of our app. Save collects the users' favorite news. Profile clear the saved news for users.

Under the Tin view, users can see the card view news grabbed from website. Users are also able to use swipe gestures to collect or dislike news. Once swiping left, the news is deemed as disliked news. On the contrary, swiping right allows uses to add the news to their favorite. Under this function, we use the SQLite database to save data. The two cute hearts are two buttons providing another way for users to like or dislike news. Clicking the gray one dislikes news and red one adds to favorites.

The second toolbar is Save. Once users click Save, they are able to see the recycle view of their favorite news. Users are also able to click the new to review. Once they click, a new page pops up and shows the detail of the news. If they would like to know more, they can also click the cute ReadMore button on our app to know the entire news on the website. It fires up a second activity. Users can also share the link or copy the link by clicking the 3 cute dots on the top right of the page.

Once users click the Profile, there is a button called clear cache. Users are able to clear the saved news by clicking clear cache button. 

We are still thinking about adding more functions to our TinNews. Hoping we can be more creative and learning more from this process.
